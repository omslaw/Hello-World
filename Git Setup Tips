a good example here:
http://lifehacker.com/5983680/how-the-heck-do-i-use-github

one way if you have existing files on your pc. you create repo with the addional files like README. 
then on local machine that already has GIT installed:

- git init   (this initializes that directory with your files.)
- git add FILENAME  
- git commit -m 'test commit' 

Now you add the repo location:

- git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git

Then to push it to the repo (but this won't work right off the bat):

- git push origin master 

Reason it won't is that I should first pull or just merge the repo:

- git pull origin master

Now you should have the repo's README file and such. Now you can add all your files in the directory if you haven't yet

- git add *
- git status    (to double check) (you don't need .pyc files, so you can remove them)
- git commit -m 'XXXXXX'
- git push origin master
